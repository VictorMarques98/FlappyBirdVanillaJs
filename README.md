  <h1>Flappy Bird Vanilla JS</h1>
</div>
<h3>Objective</h3>
<h6>This small project aims to apply my knowledge acquired on the DOM study of the Javascript program language.
The objective of the game is not to be a game in itself, but to show the possibilities that working with the DOM 
of Javascript allows us in everyday life.</h6>
<h3>What was used</h3>
<h6>In this project, only ECMA6 native commands were used without using frameworks like React, Jquery 
or something similar.The most used commands were the following:</h6>

* Dinamic Creation of DOM Elements
* Instance of Objects and Functions
* Object Orientation
* Integration between Css And Javascript
* Css(FlexBox and others funcionalities)

<h3>Prints</h3>

<h6>End Game</h6>

<h3>Controls</h3>
<h6>The keyboard buttons were used to move the bird, since when pressed, the bird goes up in reverse and makes it go down.</h6>

```sh
    window.onkeydown = e => flying = true
    window.onkeyup = e => flying = false
```
